**FastHTML**

The fastest, most powerful way to create an HTML app.

FastHTML is a new next-generation web framework for fast, scalable web applications with minimal, compact code. It’s designed to be:

Powerful and expressive enough to build the most advanced, interactive web apps you can imagine.
Fast and lightweight, so you can write less code and get more done.
Easy to learn and use, with a simple, intuitive syntax that makes it easy to build complex apps quickly.
FastHTML apps are just Python code, so you can use FastHTML with the full power of the Python language and ecosystem. FastHTML’s functionality maps 1:1 directly to HTML and HTTP, but allows them to be encapsulated using good software engineering practices—so you’ll need to understand these foundations to use this library fully.
